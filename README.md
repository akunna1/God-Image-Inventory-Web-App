### Installation for building webapp locally
- npm install react-router-dom

### Progress üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª
- Currently working on Frontend...
  
### Requirements ‚úçüèæ (For frontend)
- Three types of Account: Admin (can make posts), Client and Counselor
- One most take assessment before he/she can become a counselor
- counselor takes assessment --> Counselor creates acount --> counselor creates account for client
- login button changes to logout button. Once logged out, take user to homepage immediately

### Things to consider and Suggestions
- Menu- introduction (Overview), orientation(Guide), About, Contact
- each client having an id
- each counselor having an id
- linking client and counselor by an id
- user id vs test id?
- users wouldn't be able to submit test if all the questions aren't complete
- Example Report should be under Introduction or Orientation
- counselors choose version of test for clients
- The main assessment should reveal which answer was marked wrong or right

- Has 3 buttons
- Pictures for page?
- add details of how to be able to login in as a client (counselor creates accont) and counselor (have to take assessment first...)
